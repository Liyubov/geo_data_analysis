### Geolocation data analysis

This is README for geo_data_analysis for Lecturers without borders https://scied.network/how-lecturerswb-works/ .
Here we mostly analysis spatial dimensions of data from Lecturers without borders. 
All data is depersonalized and no data files are uploaded without permissions of the owners of the information.

More information about geolocation data analysis can be found here:

(repository in collaboration with Bastian from openhumans.org on analysis of open mobility data) 

### Aanalysis of mobility data 
In first notebook *analysis_human_mobility_opendata.ipynb* we analyse Individual mobility data from openhumans platform in order to apply it later to researchers mobility data.
We also apply some trajectories analysis techniques to characterize mobiltiy trajectory.

We also analyze global mobility data from openflights and global mobility data https://bluehub.jrc.ec.europa.eu/migration/app/index.html?state=5cc845a97758cd17cdecd1fb (accessed June 2019)

In notebook *LeWiBo_on_map.ipynb* we visualise lectures without borders on a map. Work in progress.
